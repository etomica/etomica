/**
 * An abstract iterator that generates the neighboring sites of a given site.  
 * Subclasses provide the specification of the "neighbors" of a site by a suitable
 * implementation of the updateNeighborList method.
 * <p>
 * Iterator can be configured to yield the up- and/or down-neighbors of the site.
 * The definition of "up" and "down" neighbors is made by the subclass, within
 * the restriction that if site B is an up-neighbor of site A, then A will
 * be a down-neighbor of site B.  Note that because of the way periodic boundaries
 * are treated, a transitive relation is not guaranteed,
 * meaning that (B upNbr of A) and (C upNbr of B) does not imply (C upNbr of A).
 * <p>
 * The central site is not included among the iterates (not a self-neighbor).
