/**
 * Elementary basis-dependent iterator that gives atoms meeting specification
 * of a basis and a target.  Iterates are determined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>the <i>basis atom</i> determines the set of atoms (basis-set) that are candidates for iteration.
 * If the basis is an atom group, iterates (if any) will always be the child 
 * atoms of the basis; if the basis is a leaf atom, the single iterate (if any)
 * will be the basis atom itself.
 * 
 * <li>the <i>target atom</i> narrows down the iterates from the basis-set. Possibilities
 * are: 
 * <ul>
 * <li>no target atom is specified: all basis-set atoms will be given on iteration
 * <li>the target atom is the same as the basis atom: this is equivalent to specifying no target
 * <li>the target atom is in the species hierarchy above the basis atom, and the
 * basis atom is descended from it: this is equivalent to specifying no target
 * <li>the target atom is a child of the basis atom: the target atom will be the only iterate
 * <li>the target atom is descended from the basis atom, but is not a direct child of it:
 * the only iterate will be the child atom of the basis through which the target is descended
 * <li>the target and basis are in different branches of the species hierarchy, such that
 * the target atom is not descended from the basis atom, and the basis atom is not descended
 * from the target atom: no iterates will be given
 * </ul>
 *
