/**
 * Organizer and executor of actions performed by the simulation. The Controller
 * holds a series of Actions which it performs in series, using a thread that it
 * launches when start() is invoked. A simple Action will run on the
 * Controller's thread. An Activity is a subclass of Action that runs on its own
 * thread, and can be paused or terminated (halted) before it completes
 * naturally.
 * <p>
 * The Controller thread will idle while an Activity is running. While idling,
 * the Controller will respond to "urgent actions" that another thread
 * (typically a gui) will ask it to perform. In response, the Controller will
 * pause the current Activity (or complete the Action if not an Activity),
 * perform the urgent action, and continue where it left off. This capability is
 * needed for a user to interact with a simulation that is in progress, without
 * colliding with an integrator running on this Controller.
 * <p>
 * The queue for pending Actions may be altered (given additions or deletions)
 * while Actions are being executed. As Actions are completed they are moved
 * into a list of completed Actions. When all Actions are done, the Controller
 * exits, but it may be restarted if Actions are added and start() is invoked
 * again.
 * <p>
 * Each Simulation holds a single, final instance of a Controller.
