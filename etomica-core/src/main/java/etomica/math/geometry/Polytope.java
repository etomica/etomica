 * Representation of a mathematical polytope, which is a finite region of space
 * enclosed by a finite number of hyperplanes. Subclasses include LineSegment (a
 * 1-D polytope), Polygon (a 2-D polytope), and Polyhedron (a 3-D polytope).
 * Note that the polytope may be embedded in a space of higher dimension than
 * its geometric dimension (e.g., a square -- a 2-D polytope -- by be used in a
 * three-dimensional space. A primary feature of these classes is the set of
 * points representing the vertices of the polytope. These points have the
 * dimension of the embedded space. Subclasses usually have their own internal
 * representation of the polytope that is used to calculate the vertices. It
 * restricts access to this representation to restrict the shape of the polytope
 * (e.g., a square polytope can be modified only by setting the common length of
 * its sides). A polytope can be positioned to any point in space and (to be
 * developed) given a rigid-body rotation.
