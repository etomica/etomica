/**
 * Neighbor manager for system in which there is an unchanging, one-to-one
 * correspondence between atoms and lattice cells. Each leaf atom is assigned to
 * its own cell at the beginning of the simulation, and the cell-atom assignment
 * doesn't change through the course of the simulation. Atom neighbors are
 * determined by the structure and neighbor definition associated with the cell
 * lattice, and do not change through the simulation.
 * <p>
 * The expected use for this neighbor structure is in modeling of
 * lattice systems such as the Ising model in which the coordinate represents
 * something other than the spatial position of the atom; can also be applied to
 * diffusionless crystalline solids, such as the valence-force field model,
 * single-occupancy crystals, and perhaps high-density unconstrained crystals.
