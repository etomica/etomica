/**
 * Calculates the center of mass (COM) over a set of atoms. The mass and
 * position of all atoms passed to the actionPerformed are accumulated and used
 * to compute their center of mass. Calculated COM is obtained via the getData
 * method, which returns an array with the elements of the calculated COM
 * vector, or via the getCOM method, which returns a vector with the calculated
 * COM. Calculation is zeroed via the reset method.
 * <p>
 * A typical use of this class would have it passed to the allAtoms method of an
 * iterator, or wrapped in an AtomGroupAction to calculate the COM of the atoms
 * in an atom group.
