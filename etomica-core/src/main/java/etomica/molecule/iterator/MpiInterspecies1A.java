 * are specified at construction and cannot be changed afterwards. The
 * 1-molecule species is identified via the setTarget method, and may be changed
 * from one use of the iterator to the next.
 * <p>
 * Atoms in iterate pairs are ordered such that the first atom is of the first
 * species given in the constructor, and the second atom is of the second
 * species given in the constructor, regardless of the specification of the
 * target.
 * <p>
 * Direction may be specified, and is interpreted as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For null direction, no restriction on iterates.
 * <li>For UP direction, iterates are given if index of target-atom species is
 * less than index of other species.
 * <li>For DOWN direction, iterates are given if index of target-atom species
 * is greater than index of other species.
