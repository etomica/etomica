Collects classes that extend Activity, which implements Action and is an abstract class appropriate
to encapsulate complex, time-consuming tasks.  Unlike a simple Action, an Activity can be paused
or even halted prematurely, typically through interaction with a user interface.  The class
that "runs" an Integrator, repeatedly invoking its doStep method, is an example of an Activity.
<p>
Specific sequences of actions can be defined by extending <tt>ActivityGroupSeries</tt> (which
performs the tasks sequentially) or <tt>ActivityGroupParallel</tt> (which performs the tasks
simultaneously, on separate threads).  Traversal across a series of state points, for example
to perform a thermodynamic-integration calculation, could be suitably implemented as an 
ActivityGroupSeries.
<p>
The {@link etomica.Controller Controller} is a special ActivityGroupSeries that loops through a mutable
list of Actions/Activities, performing each in turn.  Each Simulation has one Controller instance,
through which the simulation is conducted and other tasks are performed.
