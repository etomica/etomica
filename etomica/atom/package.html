Provides classes the define and organize atoms and the information related to them.  The
physical atoms that are manipulated in a simulation are represented by instances of the
class <@link etomica.atom.Atom Atom}. Atom plays a larger role than this, however. Instances of Atom 
are arranged into a tree structure, through which they organize atoms into molecules, species, and phases.
<p>
This "Atom tree" may be understood as follows:
<ul>
<li>At the top of the tree is an instance of <u>SpeciesRoot</u>, which serves as a single point of reference
for all Atom instances in the simulation.
<li>At the bottom of the tree are the "<u>leaf Atoms</u>", which correspond the physical atoms being simulated.
<li>Below the SpeciesRoot atom are instances of <u>SpeciesMaster</u>, which correspond to the phases being 
simulated.  All Atoms in the tree below a given SpeciesMaster belong to a single Phase, and are subject to interaction
with each other (Atoms in different Phases have no mutual interactions).  Every instance of a Phase has a 
single SpeciesMaster field.
<li>Below each SpeciesMaster in the tree are one or more <u>SpeciesAgent</u> instances.  There is a SpeciesAgent
for each Species that has been instantiated by the Simulation.
<li>SpeciesRoot, SpeciesMaster, and SpeciesAgent are all subclasses of Atom.
<li>Below each SpeciesAgent are Atom instances that represent the molecules of the corresponding Species.  This
is the "<u>molecule layer</u>" of the tree.  If the molecules are monatomic, this branch of the tree terminates
here, and the molecules are the physical "leaf" atoms of that species.  Note that there is no Molecule class; these
and all other nodes of the tree are (logically) Atom instances.
<li>For multiatomic species, below the molecules will be one or more levels that represent molecule subgroups
(e.g., methyl groups), and finally the physical atoms themselves (which often are directly below the molecule layer).
</ul>
The tree structure is implemented by the {@link etomica.atom.AtomTreeNode} AtomTreeNode class, 
which is held as a field by each Atom.  AtomTreeNode
is subclassed into AtomTreeNodeLeaf and AtomTreeNodeGroup, respectively, for Atoms that are leaf atoms in the 
species hierarchy, and atom groups, which include everything else.  
<p>
Information about an Atom's position in the atom hierarchy is coded in an integer index, which can
be interpreted using the methods of AtomIndexManger.  The appropriate instance of AtomIndexManager
for this purpose is held by the Atom's AtomType instance (discussed below).
<p>
The state of an Atom -- usually its position and perhaps velocity (but more general definitions are possible) --
is held by a Coordinate field (defined in {@link etomica.space etomica.space}) which is made by the governing Space
and which is provided to the Atom at construction. The conduct of the simulation primarily entails the manipulation 
of the fields of the Atom Coordinates.
<p>
The {@link etomica.atom.AtomType AtomType} class is used to hold information that is common to many Atom instances.
Each Atom has a final AtomType field that is specifed at construction. Atoms that that are group atoms (having 
AtomTreeNodeGroup as their node field) have types that are (or extend) AtomTypeGroup. Leaf atoms have types that 
extend AtomTypeLeaf. Instances of AtomType are arranged in a hierarchy that parallels that Atom hierarchy.  
Important features are as follows:
<ul>
<li>At the top of the type hierarchy is AtomTypeRoot, which is the AtomType held by SpeciesRoot.
<li>Below AtomTypeRoot is a single instance of AtomTypeGroup, which is the AtomType held by all SpeciesMaster 
instances.  The Phase an atom is in has no significance to its AtomType.
<li>Below the SpeciesMaster AtomType is an AtomType instance corresponding to each Species.  All SpeciesAgents
for a given Species reference the same AtomType.
<li>Likewise, on down the tree all similarly formed Atoms will reference the same AtomType instance.  The AtomType
tree is a condensed version of the Atom tree; it has the same number of layers, but each layer in general has
fewer nodes.
</ul>
AtomTypes are very important in defining the interactions between Atoms, as developed in the 
{@link etomica.potential etomica.potential} package.
<p>
Each Atom instance at or below the molecule layer is constructed by an {@link etomica.atom.AtomFactory AtomFactory}.
Complicated molecules are constructed by piecing together groups of atoms constructed by subfactories.  Thus the
AtomFactories can be viewed in a hierarchy that mimicks the AtomType hierarchy; accordingly there is a one-to-one 
correspondence between the AtomTypes and the AtomFactories.  The key AtomFactories are:
<ul>
<li><u>AtomFactoryMono</u>, which produces a leaf atom.
<li><u>AtomFactoryHomo</u>, which produces an Atom that groups identically-formed child atoms (made by a single
subfactory).
<li><u>AtomFactoryHetero</u>, which produces an Atom that groups heterogeneous child atoms (made by more than
one subfactory).
</ul>
This package also defines data structures used to collect Atom instances.  These include:
<ul>
<li><u>AtomSet</u>, an interface for a collection of an arbitrary (but usually small) number of atoms.
<li><u>AtomPair</u>, an AtomSet formed from exactly two Atoms.
<li><u>AtomList</u>, a linked list of Atoms; good for making mutable collections (atoms easily added and removed)
for which random access is not often demanded
<li><u>AtomArrayList</u>, a collection of Atoms which provides fast access at the expense of slower mutability
</ul>
AtomSet, and AtomPair in particular, are the expected arguments of Potential classes when calculating interatomic
interactions.  Iteration over Atoms, AtomPairs and AtomSets is provided by the classes of 
{@link etomica.atom.iterator etomica.atom.iterator}.
<p>
Atom groups hold their child Atoms in an AtomList.  Each Atom has a field the gives directly its linker
used to place it in this list. Access to this linker is needed for iterations that begin with a specific Atom.
<p>
The Parameter classes are not well developed are subject to substantial change or elimination in the near future.
